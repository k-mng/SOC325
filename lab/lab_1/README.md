Here is the [HTML hand in link](https://rpubs.com/kimng/994479) for Lab 1. Please let me know if you can access it!

| **Folder/File Name** | **Purpose** |
|:--|:--|
| [rsconnect](./rsconnect) | Package needed to upload markdown as HTML link |
| [lab-1](./lab-1.R) | My scratch notes in case I messed up something in R Markdown; ignore |
| [Lab-1-Markdown.HTML](./Lab-1-Markdown.html) | Do not be fooled- _THIS IS NOT THE HTML LINK_; this is just what my laptop generates when knitting the document. It only goes from a direct path from my computer. |
| [Lab-1-Markdown.RMD](./Lab-1-Markdown.Rmd) | My full work for the assignment. Since I purposely didn't show most of my code in the real HTML link, look here.
