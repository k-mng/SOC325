# Directory

Here is the (rough) directory of all the labs, pictures, and data that will be downloaded throughout SOC 325 Winter 2023.

It should be noted that not all folders will have a README.md file (as some of them are self explanatory). However, I will be making one in each individual Lab folder (such as in [Lab 1](./lab/lab_1)).


| **Folder Name** | **Purpose** |
|:--|:--|
| **[data](./data)** | Contains all .csv files and other data files |
| **[img](./img)** | Contains all images throughout the quarter (will also include pictures of questions) |
| **[lab](./lab)** | Will contain the majority of the homework (lab HTML links, R Markdown work, scratch notes, etc.). If you are the TA, I would recommend going here :D |
